# CTF Write-up: Linux Prison 3 (hearsay3.ctf.dscjssstuniv.in) 🚀🔐🐧

## Challenge Overview 🎯

The third installment in the Linux Prison series provided SSH access to a remote machine. The goal was to extract the flag despite system restrictions.

## Connection Details 🖥️

```bash
ssh ctf@hearsay3.ctf.dscjssstuniv.in -p 9103  
Password: ctf  
```

Once logged in, the next step was enumeration to explore the available files and potential access limitations.

## Enumeration & Initial Exploration 🔍📂

Listing the files in the current directory:

```bash
ls  
```

Revealed files:

```
README.txt  
flag.txt  
flags  
more_flags  
```

Since `flag.txt` seemed to be the primary target, the first instinct was to display its contents using common commands.

## Flag Extraction: Trial & Error Attempts 🛠️

### Attempt 1: Using cat 📜

```bash
cat flag.txt  
```

**Result:** ❌ Failed  
**Error Message:** `-rbash: cat: command not found`  
**Reason:** The system was running restricted bash (rbash), blocking certain commands.

### Attempt 2: Using less & more 📖

```bash
less flag.txt  
more flag.txt  
```

**Result:** ❌ Both commands were restricted.

### Attempt 3: Using echo for a Workaround 📢

```bash
echo "$(flag.txt)"  
```

**Result:** ❌ No output; the method failed since `flag.txt` is not an environment variable.

### Attempt 4: Checking Available Commands 🧐

Since some commands were blocked, it was useful to see what commands were permitted:

```bash
compgen -c  
```

This provided a list of allowed commands, revealing that `bash` was available, which led to the next approach.

### Attempt 5: Executing the File with bash 🏆

```bash
bash flag.txt  
```

**Result:** ✅ Success!  
**Flag Revealed:** `dscctf{cat_not_working_huh}`

## Key Findings & Lessons Learned 🧠

### 1. Restricted Shell Bypass 🚧
- `rbash` blocks common commands like `cat`, `ls`, and `more`, requiring alternative methods.
- Executing the file with `bash` worked because it allowed script execution even when direct reading was restricted.

### 2. Checking Available Commands 🔎
- Using `compgen -c` helped identify allowed commands, guiding the workaround approach.

### 3. Alternative Approaches 🤔
- In a real-world scenario, additional techniques could include:
  - Using `awk` or `sed` (if available).
  - Copying the file to a different location with looser restrictions.
  - Exploiting environment variables or symbolic links.

## Final Flag 🏁

```
dscctf{cat_not_working_huh}
```

This write-up demonstrated a different trial-and-error approach to obtaining the flag by experimenting with command restrictions and bypassing them effectively. 🎯🔥
